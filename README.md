# Branching Strategy
1. Make sure a branch is created for each User Story Epic, and accountable developers should only implement the code in the corresponding branch.
2. Pull requests will be issued for merging the branches to main.
3. Code review should be hosted every time before different branches merged to main.

# Code Review Checklist
1. [x] /sentiment
